# 💫 piracy website : <br>
##**The things that fasinate me are how the websites with no money no face no support compete with the big giants like netflix prime etc , 
<brI just thought it was going to be very difficult and ya it is but lets make a meesho verson for it cheap but working god for us .**
This is the project I created to show how piracy is done — for free or at minimum cost — and how piracy websites actually work.
<br><br>It is very simple to create, easy to run, and requires almost no manual effort.
<br>Everything is fully automated. You just send a movie to a Telegram group and the rest is done automatically.
<br><br>The same system can also be used for other purposes, such as:
<br><br>Storing data as a backup<br><br>Sharing files with friends
<br><br>You only need to change the code slightly.
<br><br>If you want to use it privately, you can:
<br><br>Add a password or authentication
<br><br>Restrict access
<br><br>With small changes, you can create your own free unlimited drive.
<br><br>Setup Instructions
<br># Go to backend folder
<br>cd backend
<br><br># Install all dependencies
<br>npm install
<br><br># Start the Telegram bot<br>node bot.js
<br><br># Start the API server<br>node server.js
<br><br><br>Make sure you are inside the backend directory while running these commands.
<br><br>Common Issue<br><br>If you face any issues while running the project:
<br><br>Check whether your IP address is registered in MongoDB Atlas
<br><br>If not, add it to the whitelist
<br><br>Restart the bot and server


<br><br>
#.env File Configuration
<br><br>Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:
